Eyeliner on her eyes, drawing me insane,
Like midnight stars in a sky with no rain.
That little flick, that perfect line,
Got me wishin' I could live in her eyes, full-time.

She blinks, and I'm lost in a dream,
Each glance feels like a movie scene.
That black magic she wears with grace,
I just wanna take eyeliner's place...

I’d be the shadow to her light,
The story behind her silent sight.
Trace her gaze like destiny,
Be the line that sets her free...

Let me live in her eyes, forever drawn,
A whisper of dusk before the dawn.
No need for wings, no need to fly—
Just let me stay in her painted sky.

Yeah, that eyeliner’s not just style—
It’s the map to her soul, mile by mile.
And me? I’m just tryin’ to reside...
In her eyes, where beauty hides.
